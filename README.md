**ColorWave Click** is an app that changes the color of background by the click of a button.

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Instagram

iMessage

Facetime
- Change my face filter to any animals, eg. Octopus
- Facetime more than 1 person

App Idea: I would like to build a app called MyPenguin. This app will be a game that places the 
responsibility on the user to tsking care a penguin. Some features I would like to implement is a timer 
that counts the number of hours a penguin should sleep, a distance meter that calculates
the distance a penguin walks around and a list that contains all the foods edible for penguins that
user can choose for penguin to eat.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

A challenge I faced was connecting the UI to Logic using Assistant. I had realized my mistake
being that of not choosing the IBAction. Once I had realized the issue and resolved it, it was 
easy to proceed onward in completing the app.
